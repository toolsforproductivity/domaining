# Keywords Techniques Details

## The Core Strategy

Key steps of the **Strategy** as provided  [here][jamie-lewis-lists],
+ Two Lists for keywords and combinations 
+ Make sure the two lists are of high quality (key step)
+ GoDaddy Bulk Domain Search and Buy

### Advantages

+ Obtain **meaningful**, **pronouncable** domain names (for a particular niche)
+ We can restrict attention to domains that are available
+ Cuts down the searching phase drastically especially if keywords are good.

### Limitations

+ Appraisal not integrated
+ Market Valuation to be done
+ Traffic ignored (for expired domains)

## Enhancements

Depending on time and interest
* Ensure the keywords are interesting and useful
* Ensure the keywords in the list are actually being searched for (in high demand)
  * Use a Keyword planner of some kind
* Expired domain analysis with traffic (for domains obtained, keywords)
  * Search in ExpiredDomains.net with keywords or bulk if available
